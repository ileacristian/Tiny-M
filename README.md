# Tiny M - Build log


### 17 Dec 2020
This will be a build log for my Tiny-M 3d printer.
I am planning to build a Tiny-M printer (which is in fact based on the Voron V0).
I'm still thinking if I should go for a Duet board or with a classic SKR Mini v2 which is way cheaper.
Things I need to figure out:
- find a list of vendors of 3d printer parts in France (since I recenly moved here and I want to get the best prices regarding shipping). - voron french discord group might be of help here
- find someone French or EU based that will be able to print the necessary parts - voron french discord group might be of help here as well
- study both V0 and Tiny-M step files, as well as [Xile's direct drive mod](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder/tree/master/Toolheads/Xile_Tiny_M).
- figure out a rough total price and keep a bom with links
